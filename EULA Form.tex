By signing this document, the user agrees to the following terms regarding the use of the \textbf{Vietnamese Mental Health Question Answering (VMHQA)} dataset.

\section{Commercial Use}
The user may only use the dataset for \textbf{academic research purposes}. Commercial use of the dataset is strictly prohibited. Prohibited commercial uses include, but are not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Training or validating the performance of commercial systems,
	\item Using any portion of the dataset in advertisements,
	\item Selling the dataset or data derived from it,
	\item Developing military applications or related tools.
\end{itemize}

\section{Distribution}
The user may not distribute the dataset or any portion of it. An exception is granted for using small portions of the dataset for academic publications or presentations, provided it is necessary for clarification.

\section{Access}
Access to the dataset is granted only after this EULA is signed and submitted to the dataset administrators. To access the dataset:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Print and sign this EULA.
	\item Scan the signed document and send it to \texttt{nghganhtu@gmail.com} (preferably in PDF format).
\end{enumerate}

A full dataset version will be issued upon receipt of the signed EULA. The user may not share these credentials or provide access to the dataset to any third party.

\section{Citation Guide}
When publishing research or presenting work that uses the VMHQA dataset, users must cite the dataset properly. The recommended citation in IEEE format is:

\begin{quote}
	T. A. H. Nguyen, Q.-D. Nguyen, H. M. Nguyen, A. H. Nguyen, and L. Nguyen, “VMHQA: A Vietnamese Multi-choice Dataset for Mental Health Domain Question Answering”, EAI Endorsed Scal Inf Syst, vol. 12, no. 4, Sep. 2025, doi: 10.4108/eetsis.7678.
\end{quote}

Alternatively, you can cite it using the provided BibTeX entry:

\begin{verbatim}
@article{article,
author = {Nguyen, Loan and Nguyen, Tu and Nguyen, Quang-Dieu and Nguyen, Harius and Nguyen, Alfred},
year = {2025},
month = {09},
pages = {},
title = {VMHQA: A Vietnamese Multi-choice Dataset for Mental Health Domain Question Answering},
volume = {12},
journal = {EAI Endorsed Transactions on Scalable Information Systems},
doi = {10.4108/eetsis.7678}
}
\end{verbatim}

Failure to properly cite the dataset may result in revocation of access or denial of future dataset requests.

\section{Changes to the Agreement}
The VMHQA dataset administrators reserve the right to modify this EULA at any time. Users will be notified of any changes and given the choice to opt out of the updated terms. Opting out will invalidate this agreement and result in losing access to the dataset.

\section{Warranty Disclaimer}
The dataset is provided without any warranty. The VMHQA dataset administrators are not responsible for any damages (financial, physical, or otherwise) resulting from using the dataset.
